                            <p>I just wanted to post this just in case anyone else had the same issue I did. SkyrimLauncher.exe would open, but when I hit play, the launcher would close and nothing happened. When I went to the Skyrim local files, TESV.exe wouldn't run because of the error in the title. I uninstalled it and reinstalled it (don't worry about your saves, they will still be there) and then in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim\DirectX10\Aug2009_d3dx9_42_x86.cab I just extracted d3dx9_42.dll. I'm having an issue. My EngineFixes\_preload.txt remains empty after loading the game. Any ideas why? I can't tell if the FPS fix is running or not. I'm getting "src\main.cpp(134): plugin was not preloaded, please read the installation instructions carefully" in my EngineFixes log. And my d3dx9\_42.dll is giving me: amp#x200B; skse64 plugin preloader - d3dx9\_42 exe path: D:\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\SkyrimSE.exe loaded into SkyrimSE.exe or SkyrimVR.exe Modlist, Load Order amp Plugins: https://modwat.ch/u/Scoobymenace/plugins Simply put, I installed Crash Fixes for better memory allocation yet despite its name it ironically has caused my game to crash every time I even try play. UseOSAllocators=1 CustomMemoryBlock=1 MemoryInfoConsole=1 SKSE Plugin Preloader is installed (Replaced the d3dx9_42.dll file in the Skyrim directory). Honestly dont know what Ive done wrong at this point. Here is a pastebin error log of the crash 
Whenever I try to start SKSE I get the error message gtC:\windows\system32\D3DX9_43.DLL is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error. About a minute later it says gtCouldn't inject DLL Closing it down gets me the error message gtThe procedure entry point D3DX9_43.DLL.#148 could not be located in the dynamic link library d3dx9_42.dll. Running it through Steam just gets me a Skyrim has stopped responding-error message Running it with all mods disabled makes Problem: ILS after launch, Continue, enter. ILS after launch, load earlier save, enter. ILS after launch, New Game, enter. By ILS I mean I waited over 10 minutes twice.

Hello! I'm fairly new to Skyrim modding, so please bear with me. Recently I found out about the mod Tamriel Online, so me and a friend decided to test it out. It worked fine for some time, until we started CTD'ing (Skyrim has stopped working). Crash Fixes (with SKSE preloader), USLEEP amp ENBoost has been installed, and STEP has been applied (.ini and cleaned Update.esm). I have created a troubleshooting post on r/TamrielOnline, but I thought I would up my chances of fixing my issues by posti. I've already posted this on /r/ultimateskyrim so i'll copy ad paste what I wrote there Hi, these two errors occur when I try to run SKSE through MO. C:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Skyrim\d3dx9_42.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or software vendor for support. Error status 0xc0000020. C:\Games\Steam\SteamApps\common\Skyrim\d3d9.dll is either Hello everyone, today I was testing Insomnia CGI ENB and SweetFX, the night was too dark, it was probably because of one of my mod, so I tried to set it brighter via the ingame enb menu, and it made the game crash. I tried to use go back to Grim and Somber but now it won't show the enb message at start and the enb is not active ingame. I tried reinstalling my ENB, to no avail. I use ENBmanger. The only thing that seems to fix it is to remove d3dx9_42.dll from skyrim folder, but it's necessary. 
Hey-o, I hope you are well! I am requesting help on a crash upon which I am at wit's end currently. It is a persistent ctd that occurs on new saves only with my fully loaded mod list within the Windhelm area. I have currently tried I feel everything except for actually combining esp in tes5edit. I have created a merged plugin list though. I have checked memory block usage which is at 512/256. I have deleted and reinstalled skyrim along with all my mods a total of three times, I have systematical. Part 1: Introduction (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/5sff35/optimizing_requiem_for_low_performance_laptops/) - See this post for what I'm doing and why. Part 2: Establishing a Baseline (https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimrequiem/comments/5slmw7/optimizing_requiem_for_low_performance_laptops/) - Gathering some baseline stats after installing Requiem and getting it working with a minimal setup. In this round of modification I am making my installation compliant with the Skyrim. Had Skyrim running fine for a while, subbed out one or two mods and it subsequently died a death. Whenever I attempt to start up the game it will pass the Skyrim logo, ENB will show in the top left, and about 2 seconds afterwards it CTDs. I've LOOTed, Bashed, and spent nearly 12 hours searching for a solution. Couldn't find anything. managed to figure out how to get a Crashdump file readable and found the exception code with information "The thread tried to read from or write to a virtual addres. I've successfully modded my Skyrim several times, never to my complete satisfaction, but it worked. I recently upgraded motherboard and processor, and updated to Windows 10 from 8. Last night, I tried to get restarted on modding, finished all the steps I'm the beginner's guide up to the part where you start adding mods. I went to test it out with SKSE, and was greeted with a message saying d3dx9_42.dll is missing, and my Skyrim couldn't run. I have the current Direct X, and despite Installation seemed simple enough, "Place d3dx9_42.dll and ssme.ini in your Skyrim folder (not the Data subfolder)." The mod description says "If it loads, it will create ssme.log in your Skyrim folder." So far I have not seen any evidence of this anywhere. I'm not sure what to do, I was looking forward to the benefits of this and the Winterhold mods I want to download are dependent on this. So I downloaded SSME so I could avoid the CTD or two I get each time I play. I put the d3dx9_42.dll and the ssme.ini in my Skyrim folder, but now when I try to open SKSE, I get this error message. ( Has anyone else encountered this problem, or even better, managed to fix it? Any help would be awesome because I really feel like I'm missing something obvious. Thanks. Okay, so I'm fairly new to modding Skyrim. I come across u/DanteVSTheWorld's Quick Guide/Tips for a 100% Stable Skyrim ( on this subreddit and try to follow it's directions to make my modded game less laggy and have less CTDs. Upgraded my SKSE to the newest alpha version. Cleaned a few BSAs with TES5Edit, sorted by load order with BOSS, and got StableUGridsToLoad working. Got some damn good improved perfo. 
EDIT-- Found a fix. Go into C:\Windows\SYSTEM32 and find d3dx9_42.dll and delete it. I put it on a flash drive just in case. When you try to launch again, it should say that the file is missing, not broken. Just go re download directX from Microsoft's website and that fixed me right up. Hey guys, I got SE earlier today and have spent a decent amount of time trying to troubleshoot from other people's fixes and so far I haven't had any luck. When I try to launch from Steam, the launcher. My build: R9 270x card with an FX-6300 six core processor. A Gigabyte Ultra-durable motherboard. A 2 TB HHD, and a fresh install of Windows 8.1. My issue: When playing games that rely mainly on DirectX (Specifically DX9) I get generic .dll error messages. For example: On Skyrim I get a "d3dx9_42.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error." What I've tried: I've tried updating my drivers and reinstalling the program, I've also installed Microsoft's Web runtime </p>
