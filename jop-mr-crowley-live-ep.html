                            <p>I recently helped my mom move from San Leandro to Pleasant Hill, which is closer to me, warmer and nicer. During the move we found all kind of classic #ThrowbackThursday material. She gave me a handful of old pictures the other day including the one below. I want to say this picture is from somewhere around early 1985, before my Dad and her split up, and before my mom kicked me out of the house. I already had my Kramer strat shaped guitar which meant that it was after I had my dishwashing Happy Day, Everyone.Here Clearing Out. Please feel free to DM if Interested. Enjoy the Day.

This is a list of about 214 12” singles, 11 10” singles and a couple of 7” singles. The focus is on club music that was filling clubs in London in 1981-1985, with a particular emphasis on: newly emerging electro-funk (including the first bits of hip-hop) mostly coming out of NY and DC cross-over between post-punk and dance, that typically filled the Camden Palace thursday night gig, the Anvil and related London clubs remixes of non-disco dance stuff from that period UK electro 
Please note: There are companies included in the list that are not indies: AAA, CMLL, NJPW, ROH, Impact, etc. being prime examples. I chose to include these though as I felt a lot of people weren't aware of them and this might get some more eyes on them. (Also note links to GWN might redirect to their splash page if you aren’t logged in) Now onto the Free stuff: Shows: CWF Worldwide Episode 151 (https://www.twitch.tv/videos/245687607) Championship Wrestling From Hollywood: Episode. SURVIVOR - Now updated with Station to Station! ampnbsp; I thought nothing, could drive this away. Heroes has been eliminated with 69 votes, coming to 56% of all votes this round. This final round was quite hotly contended, as one would imagine, but in the end it was Station to Station that came out on top, beating the one and only Heroes for our #1 spot. The final tally was 69 votes to eliminate Heroes, to the 55 for Station to Station. ampnbsp; I doubt Some redditors have already made a connection between " Comet Ping Pong Pizza " in Washington, DC and " Pizza Planet ", the fictional space-themed pizza restaurant in the Disney film " Toy Story ". Personally, when I first heard of Comet Ping Pong, Pizza Planet was the first thing I thought of. It is ESPECIALLY creepy to think about that connection now because redditors have found a connection between three individuals: Sasha (aka "Anita") Lord , a "booker" and "promoter" who works. Verified? (This bot cannot verify AMAs just yet) Date: 2014-06-02 Link to submission ( ( Has self-text ) Questions Answers :-- :-- Everyone over at /r/survivor really appreciate you and other former contestants doing these AMAs! Can you speak to either of these rumors surrounding the game play of your season? Fairplay not quitting for his family, but because he had a broken jaw and needed painkillers, but was refused by product. </p>
