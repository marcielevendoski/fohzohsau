# While this is useful for archiving purposes, we recommend you try and switch to the folks over at LineageOS (https://lineageos.org/) if possible! # TORRENT IS UP ## Download torrent here ( (412gb - can partial download/seed no problem, any help is appreciated) Hello all. Over the past couple days I've been working on archiving all the CM sites & downloads, and I'm pleased to say I've got (mostly) everything. I have successfully obtained. For example, here is the LG G4 download page. The right-most column is labeled "Date Added." What time zone are they using? GMT? https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=h811. These downloads ( are all over http, and the checksums are MD5, which hasnt been secure for what, ten years. SHA256 already. Magnet links would be good too. (not sure what they are checksums/ merkle roots (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) perhaps) Or sign it with GPG. Of course the website not being https(even if. https itself not being entirely secure due to the dubious certificate system) at least using secure hashes might show up as inconsiste. I went over to https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=hammerhead to get a KitKat ROM, and didn't find anything KitKat related and the old ROMs there had been removed. So does anyone know where I could find these It seems like the servers are going down a little bit earlier than December 31st, since the main cyanogenmod.org website is already down, and some download mirrors are also unavailable. Possibly the build servers are also down, that probably means that today's nightly is the last one we will see in a while. I'm right now downloading the 25/12 nightlies for osprey and falcon (Moto G3, Moto G), and I would advise you to do the same if your device has official 14.1 nightlies (if you're So this happened: https://cyngn.com/blog/cyanogen-services-shutting-down and according to that, looks like the get.cm, the server that hosts the nightlies and builds them is also gonna shut down. Now even though I use an iphone for my primary phone, I still flash CM14.1 every now and then in my current android phone which isn't gonna get Android N updates. This is a really bad news for a lot of people. So I thought I'd try to download all the snapshots (stable version) and latest nightlies. 
This thread is no longer relevant. Please use the official CM12 nightly builds, available here ( The Hearthstone Hack will return at some point in the future. https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=hammerheadcaf&type=nightly. OKAY GUYS I AM SO EXCITED I AM GOING TO TURN OFF CAPS LOCK NOW!!! So I was browsing the wayback machine and decided to see if downloads worked, guys, IT DOES! You have to find a direct link to the download page, trying to navigate around the archived website is BROKEN as hell. Example: You will have to use device codename here) This should work fine, it worked great for me when I was looking for a Nexus 10 CM 10.2 link. I am so excited I noticed the guide on the sidebar hasn't been updated in awhile, so I decided to make this post to help others. I hope this helps you guys, good luck! THIS GUIDE IS FOR ALL VARIANTS OF THE LG G3 ------------------------------------------------ Rooting: There are many methods that I have found that work on both Kitkat and Lollipop. Method 1 ( Method 2 (http://forum.xda-developers.com/lg-. Site is down: https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=jfltexx and I cant seem to find another Edit(thanks to /u/bscotth): GApps for Android 
Here is the changelog for the next CM12.1 nightly (the one after 21/4): Very happy about it as I missed it in Lollipop EDIT: Looks like we are also getting updated to Android 5.1.1 in the next nightly: EDIT2: Well it's available for download: https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=bacon EDIT3: Just updated to 22th nightly from 18th. Feels awesome to be running the latest Android 5.1.1 after only a day or two of it being. Cyanogenmod's official website (https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=ferrari) says "Over Quota". I imagine no one is going to resuscitate. Edit: Well it looks like Xposed is officially available for Nougat https://www.xda-developers.com/official-xposed-framework-android-nougat/ so I am just going to use Lineage OS 14.1 https://download.lineageos.org/d2vzw. So far the nightlies are running great. I can't believe this phone is still kicking after 5+ years. This will be good while I wait for the unlocked LG v30 to finally release. ~~Long story short, my Nexus 6P died and I had to go back to my old GS3. When you go to https://downloa. https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=surnia. https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=mako. First up, Bought the OnePlusOne and as usual, it took me time getting myself accustomed to the huge 5.5 inch display. As soon as I got comfortable, I decided to personalize it and bring out the best in the phone. 1. Everyone wants to be on the latest OS build and so do I. Hence installed CM12.1 (Currently on nightly 14-5). So now I'm on Lollipop 5.1.1. Next I need to fix things.

I wanted to share my experience of the past 4-5 days where I tried to root, failed, tried again, bricked my phone and then managed to make it work again. English is not my first language to please ignore any mistakes in that regards. Disclaimer: This was my first time rooting, I am completely new to this, I do not have a background in computers. It's a long post. Pre-Root Details Samsung Galaxy S5 : Canada (Rogers), SM-G900W8 Android Version: Lolipop 5.1.1 Reason to Root: I have a SM-G900R7 Samsung Galaxy S5 on Ntelos. I have the US Cellular CyanogenMod (https://download.cyanogenmod.org/?device=klteusc) as recommended by this. ( I did a clean install before flashing and flashed Pico GApps. Phone calling, data, and sending sms work, but I cannot recieve SMS or send/recieve MMS. I have checked my APN and it is correct. I've tried the stock messaging app which. I am creating this post in order to stop the flow of "When do I get Lollipop?" posts. I am going to add hopefully everything we know about its arrival and try to answer any questions in comments. Note: I do not work for Motorola, I'm just in the community. What we know: It will be 5.0.2, avoiding some bugs from earlier releases. 2013 will get all new 2014 features except for hardware-limited things such as infrared sensors.
