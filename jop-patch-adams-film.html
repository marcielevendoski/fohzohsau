                            <p> Most scientists are bound to ethical guidelines and in doing so they can be recognized by psychological institutions and get their work peer reviewed. I'm wondering if there is anyone who sacrifices the peer review process and ethical guidelines to perform their own brand of research. A second question is what ramifications are there for those trained in science who break the rules of psychological institutions, but not the law? For example, let's say someone puts together Milgram's experiment. 
Many critics and filmmakers have called out Life is Beautiful was offensive and insulting in its approach to the subject matter: A comedy movie set in the concentration camp, making light of the immensely dark matter. Mel Brooks famously despited the movie and Jonathan Rosenbaum lambasted the film by comparing it to Bicycle Thieves. It seems the movie's reception has retrospectively gotten worse with the 59 Metacritic score. What do you think of Life is Beautiful? My interpretation I️ don’t think I️ have watched it since it was in theaters. I️ remember it being the first movie I️ cried watching in a theater. I️ was young. Watching it again is crazy and sad in the same ways but also completely different ones. Watching scenes between two actors (Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Robin Williams) that I️ grew up watching that are both dead now is an interesting feeling that I️ don’t believe I️ have had before (I’m. I read Disaster Artist on a whim when the movie came out. I’ve since gone through the audiobook 3.5 times and can confidently say it’s one of my favorite books of all time. I expected just to hear funny anecdotes about the making of a famously awful movie and the man behind it, but I found so much more depth. In my eyes, Disaster Artist is an examination of insanity (which I am defining as “the inability to perceive reality to the degree of low or non-functionality in regular life”). He had one okay movie - Good Morning Vietnam. Aside from that, name one movie in which he wasn't either (a) horrifically unfunny, or (b) absolutely desperate. And don't even get me started on Mork amp Mindy. amp#x200B; Even looking at his filmography - it's really difficult to pick out any that weren't total garbage. Popeye, Hook, Toys, Patch Adams, Flubber, Jack - all complete trash. amp#x200B; Birdcage - being gay is the funniest joke in the world.

Day 1: ampnbsp; I am an automation engineer, and this is my log. I'm leaving it here in the hopes that someone, someday, investigates this CATASTROPHIC failure of bureaucracy, military intelligence, and government contracting. ampnbsp; The 'ESS William J. Clinton' has been completely destroyed, primarily due to the incompetence of its construction staff and officer crew. The enlisted men aboard the Clinton and the engineering staff performed flawlessly Hi, my beloved truelesbians. Following an idea sparked by a comment from u/vistarmonei, I decided to put together a list of lesbian related films. A Lesbian Movie Database of sorts, or LMDB, if you will. :) I've listed the films alphabetically and included a link to the IMDB entry for each. I've tried to keep the blurbs spoiler-free. Some of these films have only marginal connections to lesbians, like _Mulholland Drive_, but I felt they should be included. In some cases, the characters could. Since I watched it for the first time, I've always wondered why the heck critics absolutely despised Patch Adams. I thought it was a heartfelt story and -- as to quote the critics -- "It extracts tears individually by liposuction, without anesthesia!" Why is this a bad thing? If a movie can make me sad, so be it. That means it delivers a powerful message, and it's hard to find that nowadays. Additionally, Patch Adams himself brought down the movie, saying that it "sacrificed much of his message. I was recently watching a scene from Patch Adams between Robin Williams and Philip Seymour Hoffman and it got me thinking. What is the most recent film where everyone who acted in it is dead? My first thought would be something from the 40s but is there something more recent with a small cast perhaps? Is there some morbid version of the Bechdel It is Part 2 of the previous post about 'hey, want some cool stuff?' Extracted from Paranoia-live.net (https://Paranoia-live.net) forum. Autors mentioned in the beginning of their original posts, gadgets marked in bold  Deevyde Wrath of God This simple gun emits a low powered laser beam (think laser pointer) that apparently has no effect. However, it makes whoever the beam hits \ INCREDIBLY\ unlucky. I'm not just talking botched rolls here, I'm talking ceiling randomly collapsing.
